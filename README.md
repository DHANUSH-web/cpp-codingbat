# C++ Starter

This repository contains starter code and resources for C++ programming. It is designed to help beginners get started with writing and understanding C++ programs, without spending too much time for project setup and build configurations.

## Features

- Basic C++ program structure
- Examples of common C++ programming concepts
- Instructions for compiling and running C++ programs

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository and sync the submodules:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DHANUSH-web/cpp-starter.git --recurse-submodules
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd cpp-starter
    ```
3. Build the project using the provided script:
    ```bash
    # For only building
    ./build build           # builds in debug by default [RECOMMENDED]
    ./build build --debug   # builds in debug preset
    ./build build --release # builds in release preset
    ./build build --all     # builds both debug and release preset
    # For build and run
    ./build run             # runs in debug by default [RECOMMENDED]
    ./build run --debug     # runs in debug preset
    ./build run --release   # runs in release preset
    ```
   This will:
   - Create a build directory
   - Configure CMake with the default preset
   - Build the project
   - Runs the executable
4. Run unit tests (GoogleTest):
    ```bash
    ./build test            # runs tests in debug by default [RECOMMENDED]
    ./build test --debug    # runs tests in debug preset
    ./build test --release  # runs tests in release preset
    ```
5. Clean the project
    ```bash
    ./build clean           # cleans the entire build [RECOMMENDED]
    ./build clean --debug   # cleans only debug build
    ./build clean --release # cleans only release build
    ```

**Note:** You can also use `./build help` to learn about the `./build` command usage
